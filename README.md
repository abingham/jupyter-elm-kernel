This only vaguely works right now. I'm still figuring it all out. Any help would be great.

# Installation

Install from PyPI:
```
pip install elm_kernel
```

or from source:
```
python setup.py install
```

Then install the kernel spec:
```
python -m elm_kernel.install
```

# Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` and select the Elm kernel for a new notebook.
